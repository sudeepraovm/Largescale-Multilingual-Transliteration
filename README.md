# Largescale-Multilingual-Transliteration

This is an implementation of a system to transliterate text from one language to a different language with a high accuracy. This was realized using an attention based model, which was adapted from the Seq2seq package in TensorFlow. The model was trained using a self-created Dataset by scraping over two million proper nouns from Wikidata in 40 different languages.                                                                                                                                                                                     
NOTE: This is a research project that I am working on as a part of Prof. Mitesh Khapraâ€™s research group. We are currently trying to improve the accuracy of transliteration for difficult languages like Chinese, Korean, Russian etc. We are also trying to create a unified model that can transliterate text from one language to multiple languages at a time.
